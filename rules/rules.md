<h1>Minecraft Forum Rules</h1>

Above all else Minecraft Forum serves to provide a safe, secure and family friendly environment for Minecraft fans of all ages to share and enhance their love for Minecraft, through news, videos, downloadable content and discussion. A constructive, respectful and welcoming approach is required from all members at all times, in both public posts and private conversations.

The forum rules are a combination of behaviour guidelines and concrete rules, each forum rule includes an explanation of the rule and information on the action that should be taken by moderators. Moderators operate in line with our Moderator Guidelines and can make decisions independent of the rules listed here.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the rules please [Contact Us](http://www.minecraftforum.net/about/support). Thank you!

# Behaviour Guidelines

* __Be nice and polite__, every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel comfortable in.

* __Think before posting__, sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand what is being communicated and encourage better discussion.

* __Post in relevant sections__, this will ensure that each thread is seen by members most interested in the subject.

* __Remain on topic__, a new thread should be created for any significant deviation from the topic of the opening post.

* __Report rule violations__, to staff members for review, any content that needs moderator attention should be reported.

* __Abide by developers terms of service__, Minecraft is available on a variety of platforms authored by a variety of developers, each platform and developer has their own Terms of Service and Minecraft Forum members are required to abide by these at all times. This includes the [Mojang EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula), [Xbox Terms Of Use](http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Legal/LiveTOU), Sony [PlayStation 4](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-eula/), [PlayStation 3](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps3-eula/) and [PlayStation Vita](http://www.scei.co.jp/psvita-eula/), [Wii U and Switch](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/info/en_na/docs.jsp) Terms of Service, [iTunes Store Terms and Conditions](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html) and the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html).

* __Do not use profanity or post inappropriate content__, as a family friendly forum we require that all content is suitable for people of all ages, this includes words, videos and pictures. Any posts containing inappropriate content or profanity (including self censored, automatically censored, acronyms and slang) will be removed from the forum.

* __Do not behave in a malicious or disruptive manner__, behaviour that can cause distress, harm or inconvenience to other members, staff or the forum itself is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, discrimination, bullying, offensive material, using multiple forum accounts, breaching others privacy and accessing others accounts without permission.

# Global Rules

The Minecraft Forum Global Rules apply to each section of the website, including the Forum, Private Messages, Profile Comments, Article Comments and Server Comments.

## Advertising

Promoting something on the forum is advertising, advertising includes Minecraft related things, like YouTube videos, servers and development services, and includes non-Minecraft things, like Kickstarter projects, games and surveys. Advertising on the forum is only permitted if a relevant forum section exists for the content that is to be advertised, for example advertising Minecraft Servers is permitted in the [Minecraft Servers](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers) section, and advertising Minecraft based YouTube videos is permitted in the [Show Your Creation](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation) section. Any advertising that does not fit into a section is not allowed unless an administrator has provided permission, please [Contact Us](http://www.minecraftforum.net/about/support) to obtain permission.

> Moderators should move advertising to the correct section where possible, otherwise a warning for Advertising should be issued and the post should be deleted. Members who repeatedly advertise after warnings, either in the wrong section or advertising that isn't permitted, should be submitted for Member Administrative Review.

## Bumping

Posting in a thread with the sole intention of bringing the thread back to the top of the section without providing any additional content to the thread is bumping. The forum does not permit bumping because it benefits the thread author at the expense of other forum users by giving the impression that there is a new content in the thread and pushing threads with new content further down the list.

The most common form that bumping takes is a post containing just the word "bump", however some members are more sophisticated and may bump with posts tangentially related to the subject but without value. For example in Servers more sophisticated bumping can take the form of "We're still looking for players!" or "There are 10 people online". The easiest way to differentiate a bump from a legitimate post is to consider whether or not the post provides any value for visitors to the thread, both new and returning.

> Moderators should delete bumping posts and issue a Bumping warning. A Member Administrative Review should be created if a member has been warned multiple times for bumping or if they've bumped a single thread a substantial amount -- more than 20 posts.

## Flaming

Any rude, insulting or upsetting behaviour towards another member is flaming, and any disrespectful behaviour that can be seen to encourage rude, insulting or upsetting responses is flame baiting. Members must be polite and constructive when interacting with others on the forum, and when other members are flaming or flame baiting the report system must be used instead of engaging with similar responses.

> Moderators should delete any post that contains flaming or flame baiting and issue the appropriate warning. A Member Administrative Review should be created for any member who has been warned multiple times about flaming or flame baiting.

## Stolen Content

Any content distributed or modified on the forum must be used with permission from the rights holder, either permission provided through compliance with the content's license or explicit permission provided via a Private Message or email, a copy of explicit permission must be included in the post.

By complying with the author's rights to their work we show respect to those who have dedicated their time and energy to create the things we enjoy as well as satisfying applicable laws regarding creative works. This respect ensures that we will benefit from the efforts of creative individuals now and in the future.

> Moderators should delete any post used to distribute content in whole by someone who does not have permission from the content creator and issue a Stolen Content warning. Moderators should issue a License Violation warning for any content that uses assets from an original work without permission, or if assets are used and distributed in violation of the original works license. A License Violation warning should be given with a 48 hour notice to bring the content in compliance, if the content is not brought into compliance within 48 hours the post should be deleted.

## Duplicate Threads

Posting duplicate threads is not allowed on the Minecraft Forum. Posting an identical copy, same idea, etc. would be considered a duplicate thread since you are posting multiple threads about the same idea. For example, posting 4 threads about your server would be considered duplicates even though they contain different content.

> Moderators should delete duplicate threads and issue a Duplicate Thread warning. However, sometimes when the spam filter is cleared, it appears that a member has posted duplicate threads when they really have not. A moderator will look into it and resolve the problem as quickly as they can.

## Trolling

Content that purposely baits members (Trolling) is not allowed on the Minecraft Forum. This includes instigating flame wars, misleading them with false content, or trying to upset someone to get an angry response from them.

Along with trolling comes Troll Calling. Members should be polite while using the forums. Calling someone a "Troll" is not only not relevant to the conversation but it also is rude towards the other member when they may not actually be trolling. If someone is trolling, you can instead report the post and move on.

> Moderators should remove the instance of trolling immediately and issue the Trolling warning. For Troll Calling, a moderator should remove the instance and issue a Troll Calling warning and then they'll look into the situation to see if the offending member really was trolling.

## Necroposting

Necroposting happens when you post on a really old thread bringing it back to the front page. The front page is reserved for active discussions. If a thread isn't truly active, then it can mislead other members.

> Moderators should delete the offending post and then issue a Necroposting warning.

## Hate Speech

Hate Speech occurs when you insult, discriminate, threaten, or offend someone based on their race, color, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other traits. Members should be polite and kind to all members of the community regardless of their race, color, religion, sexual orientation, disability, etc.

Hate Speech is not tolerated on the Minecraft Forum.

> Moderators should delete the post and issue a Hate Speech warning. Any further instances of Hate Speech from the offending member would result in a permanent removal from the forum.

## Mini-Modding

Any posts implying that you are a member of the Minecraft Forum Staff while you are not would be considered mini-modding. Posts like "This thread will be locked", "You're breaking the bumping rule, reported", etc. are instances of mini-modding. While we appreciate the support, you need to report the post.

Replying to the post can confuse the member and can cause further inconvenience to our members. Moderators have the knowledge and the tools to ensure that member understand the rules.

If you're interested in applying for the moderator posting, you can read more about it [In the FAQ](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/517688-frequently-asked-questions).

> Moderators should delete the mini-modding post and issue a Mini-Modding warning. If the member they were talking about did in fact violate the rules, deal with that member accordingly.

## Profanity

Profanity is not allowed on the Minecraft Forum. Language that is considered inappropriate will be automatically censored. Just because it's censored does not mean you're allowed to use the word. There is no excuse to use profanity. Any posts containing profanity will be removed. That includes self censored (sh** or f**k), automatically censored (****), acronyms (wtf), and slang (bs).

> Profanity posts should be instantly removed and a warning issued for Profanity. If you think it's profanity and you aren't sure or you're just confused in general, ask in staff-moderation! We're a team and we're here to help one another. If you aren't sure, be safe and just delete the post (It can always be undeleted later) and escalate the report.

## Affiliate/Referral Links

You may not use the Minecraft Forum to generate income for you using affiliate links or referral links. This includes services that produce revenue for you and links that give you discounts for services. 

> Moderators should remove the link or code and issue a warning for Affiliate/Referral Links. 

## Monetary Link Abuse

The uses of monetary linking services (eg: AdFly) is only permited when you are distributing content that you created and when the content abides by the Terms of Service of the linking service. Do not use monetary links for advertising other member's content.

> Moderators should remove the link and issue a Monetary Link Abuse.

## Blacklist

List that says a person should be banned from every server. Can also be a list of servers to not play on. These lists have been used to hurt innocent people in the past. Blacklists include but are not limited to "Ban this player immediately" and "Don't play on this server it's terrible".

> Moderators should delete the post or thread and issue a warning for Blacklist.

## Spamming

A spam post is a post that provides no value to the discussion, or a thread that creates nuisance for others. The most common spam posts are posting "tl:dr;", "+1", "this", posting image macros, and nothing but memes or images. Threads are considered spam when they are duplicates, or devoid of valuable content. Replying to spam is not permitted either

> Moderators should remove the spam and issue a warning for spamming

### Bot Spam

Bots that automatically spam services/websites are not allowed on the forums. 

> Moderators first need to identify the bot spam. Note: There is a difference between spam and bot spam. Bot spam is from a service where as normal spam is obvious that a member posted it. Then, the moderator should mark the content as spam. It's important not to mark normal spam as spam because if you do, the spam filter will filter content like that out. Only mark bot spam as spam. From there, issue a bot spam warning.Affiliate

### Giftcode Spam 

Spamming giftcodes on the forums is not allowed. Websites that require users to post a certain phrase, post on multiple pages, or sign up exist ohly to phish, generate money, surveys, infect computers with malware, etc. 

> Moderators should delete the post and issue a Giftcode Spam warning.

### Member/Image Posting

Posts that contain only image macros or memers are spam. 

> Moderators should delete the post and issue a Member/Image Posting warning.

## Double Posting 

Posting on a thread after already posting is double posting. Instead, use the edit post button.

> Moderators should merge the posts and issue a Double Posting warning.

## Hoax

Don't post hoaxes on the fourm. Hoaxes such as Herobrine sightings or Minecraft 2.0 spread false information and just confuse other members.

> Moderators should delete the hoax and issue a Hoax warning.

## Off-Topic

Stay on topic when posting on the forums. Going off topic is not allowed.

> Moderators should remove the post(s) that are off topic and issue an Off-Topic warning to the violating member(s).

## Piracy 

Supporting piracy or requesting pirated content as well as posting pirated content is not allowed on the forums. 

> If someone is supporting, requesting, promote, or ask for help for pirated content, the moderator should delete the instance and issue a Piracy Support/Request/Promotion warning. If the member posted the pirated content, they should delete the instance and issue a Pirated Content warning. If they have already received the warning, issue it again and post a Member Administrative Review under the Trello Forum Moderation board.

## Sharing the Minecraft.jar

Sharing Minecraft files is against the Minecraft Terms of Use, regardless of the reason for sharing. Therefore, it's against the Minecraft Forum rules.

> The moderator should delete the post and issue a Sharing Minecraft.jar warning.

# Section Rules

The Minecraft Forum Section Rules apply to the specified section in addition to the Global Rules, where there are conflicts the Section Rules take priority over the Global Rules, meaning a section can allow (or disallow) something that is allowed (or disallowed) elsewhere on the forum.

## Minecraft Discussion

Minecraft Discussion does not permit threads advertising Minecraft Servers, visitors do not visit the Minecraft Discussion to find Minecraft Servers.

> Moderators should delete any thread made to advertise a server in any Minecraft Discussion section and issue a formal Wrong Section Servers warning. Formal warnings are used because members are usually aware it's the wrong section and make the thread anyway because of the additional exposure their server will receive.

### Suggestions

#### Constructive Replies

Replies to suggestions must be constructive criticism of the suggestion or offer ideas on how to expand the original idea, posts containing just `Support` or `No Support` are not constructive.

> Moderators should delete any post that isn't constructive, a member who is persistently making posts that aren't constructive should be issued a Spamming warning.

#### Wishlists

A wishlist is a thread with a series of unrelated suggestions, multiple items per suggestion are permitted as long as they are related, wishlists aren't allowed because they don't tend to produce constructive discussion. For example a suggestion about a gardening update featuring new plants, tools, and gardening type blocks would be allowed. However, a suggestion featuring a new dragon mob, emerald armor, and new command block commands would not be allowed.

> Moderators should lock Wishlists and reply informing the user they must create an individual thread for each suggestion.

#### Duplicate Suggestions

Suggestions should be limited to one active thread at a time, an active thread is one that has had a post made within the last month.

> Moderators should lock new threads created about an active suggestion and reply with a link to the active thread and encourage the member to expand on the idea in a reply.

### Seeds

Seeds must be for the Vanilla Minecraft game, and must be included in the opening post of the thread.

> Moderators should delete any thread that does not meet these requirements.

## Mapping and Modding

### Update Spam

Do not ask creators of Minecraft Mods and Minecraft Resource Packs to update their content and do not ask for information on when an update may be released. These posts provide no value in the threads and they inconvenience the creators. If a content creator has information on an update they will post that information in their thread.

> Moderators should delete the post and issue an Update Spam warning.

## Console Editions

### Console Modification

Modifications to the console editions of Minecraft or any other game are against Microsoft's TOS and Sony's TOS. Therefor, modifying consoles hardware and software is not allowed on the Minecraft Forum. This includes discussing, linking, sharing, or distributing. 

> Moderators should remove the violating thread and issue a Modification (Console) warning. 

## Servers

### Bumping

Some posts that may appear to be bumping in the Servers section are permitted:

* Encouraging members to post their Minecraft username to receive access to the server or a specific rank. This is permitted because it allows server owners to use their Minecraft Forum thread to manage applications to access their server, and communicates to visitors which servers are popular.
* Posting about a major update, information that impacts a lot of players. For example announcing a new website or significant changes to the server. Frequent changes that have limited impact, such as packages selling out or additional builds on the server are not considered major updates.

### Minecraft Server Hosts

The Minecraft Server Hosting section is a restricted section which requires an application to advertise in. The application process is outlined in the [How to advertise your Minecraft Server Host on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers/minecraft-server-hosting/2608188-how-to-advertise-your-minecraft-server-host-on-the) sticky thread in the section.

> Moderators **must not** move threads to the Minecraft Server Hosting section, any thread advertising a Minecraft Server Host made elsewhere on the forum must be deleted and an Advertising warning should be issued.

### Server Recruitment

The Server Recruitment section is for server staff recruitment only. You cannot recruit for teams, advertise/recruit for services, posting videos/lets plays, etc. Member responses must not be "pm me" or "add me". Interested applicants must post on threads recruiting staff members NOT posting a new thread of their application and expecting server owners to find them.

> If moderators see someone advertising their server (Or "recruiting players"), they issue a warning for "Wrong Section Servers" and <kbd>Move</kbd> the thread to the PC Servers section or the appropriate servers section. For advertising/recruit services, they issue the "Advertising" warning.

### Cracked/Offline Server Advertisement

Cracked or Offline Servers are not allowed to be posted on the Minecraft Forum at all. Servers that advertise as such are not allowed. They aren't allowed to be advertised in threads, posts, signatures, private messages, etc. 

> If moderators see the server advertised in threads or posts, they should delete it and issue a warning for Cracked/Offline Server Advertisement. If they see it in signatures or private messages, they should post a card on Trello in the Forum Moderation board for an admin to process.

### Server Drama

Members should not participate or start in server drama. The forums are not the place for arguments or disputes.

> The moderator should remove the drama and issue the Server Drama warning to the violating member(s)

## Support

### Hijacking

Members must create their own thread to request support for the issue they're experiencing, they must not post requests for support in another members thread, this is called "Hijacking". Multiple requests for support in a single thread create confusion between the people requesting support and the people providing support.

> When a member hijacks a thread an informal warning should be issued. If the post contains enough information for support to be provided the post should be moved to a new thread in the section using the <kbd>Move</kbd> option, if the post contains no information it should be deleted.

## Show Your Creation

Show Your Creation is a section for members to share their own Minecraft related artistic works.

> Moderators should remove any content that isn't Minecraft related and issue a Friendly Rules Reminder to inform the member that any future posts in the section must be Minecraft related.

### Screenshots

#### Embed Screenshots

A collection of links is difficult to view, embedded images provide a much better user experience. Screenshots must be embedded using the `[img]` bbcode.

> Moderators should fix any posts that don't embed their screenshots and inform the member via Private Message how they can embed by providing a link to the FAQ.

### Videos

Members are permitted to post a new thread for each video they create or keep one thread updated with new videos in replies.

#### Channel Linking

The videos section is for members to share their videos, and others to find individual videos to watch. Each thread in the Videos section must contain at least one video, threads should not contain just a link to a YouTube channel.

> Moderators should remove a thread if it is just a link to a YouTube channel and a warning for Channel Linking should be issued.

### Art Shops and Requests

#### Shop Reviews

Art Shop owners aren't permitted to post reviews of other shops or comments about the quality of the shop because this can create a hostile environment and cause arguments amongst members.

> Moderators should remove reviews posted by other Art Shop owners, if the review is inflammatory then a warning for Flame Baiting should be issued, otherwise a warning for Spamming should be issued.

# Moderation Process

## Warnings and Bans

If you receive a formal warning from a member of the moderation staff, there are 3 possible outcomes. An Informal Warning, Formal Warning, and a Ban. To receive a ban, you need to accumulate a certain amount of warning points.

Informal warnings add no points to your account. However, formal warnings add points to your account based on the warning you get. Every 30 days you loose a point.

If you accumulate too many warning points, you'll receive posting suspensions. You start receiving posting suspensions at 3 warning.

## Moderation Process

Our forums are moderated by our team of moderators and administrators. There are different stages we go through from detection to execution.

We start off with identification. Moderators identify rule violations through browsing the forums and through reports (Reports being our primary method). Upon receiving a report, we read through the report and open up the thread. Once we identify the rule violation, we determine what needs to be done.

The moderators then remove the post (Or edit it/lock it as needed). From there, a warning is issued to you by a moderator and they can choose to either issue a formal or informal warning depending on the situation, previous warnings, and what rule was violated. Then, a message is sent to you requiring you to read the rules and then you can view the message and appeal it as necessary.

For more information, you can read our [moderation guidelines](). To learn more about our forum, you can read our [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)]().
