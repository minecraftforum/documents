# Staff Code of Conduct

Minecraft Forum staff members represent the Minecraft Forum both on and off the forum, and their behaviour must reflect on the high standards we hold ourselves to.

## Communication

Public and private communication between staff and members must be polite and constructive at all times, every member must be given the opportunity to voice their questions or concerns and receive a fair and measured response. If a staff member feels they aren't able to provide an adequate response for any reason, such as conflict of interest or lack of knowledge, they should defer to another staff member who can.

## Privacy

The privacy of each member of the forum must be respected at all times regardless of their behaviour. Any private information must not be disclosed to any non staff member without the members explicit permission. Private information includes warnings, IP addresses, email addresses, reports and private discussions.

## Transparency

Moderation and management policy, decisions and procedures should be transparent between forum staff and members. Staff members are encouraged to provide insight into the inner workings of the forum to any member interested, and to involve the community in decisions that impact their use of the forum. 

## Conflicts of Interest

Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest must be addressed by escalating to a staff member who does not have any perceived or actual conflict. For example moderators should not moderate their own threads, and administrators should not handle appeals against warnings they have issued.

# Staff Responsibilities

The Minecraft Forum Staff are responsible for ensuring that the Minecraft Forum is an excellent resource for Minecraft players to learn about the game, discover new content and share their creations, while fostering a friendly and welcoming environment for all.

## Site Administrators

Site Administrators are responsible for identifying the needs of staff, members and users, and using this information to shape the forum, including forum organisation, features and policy. Site Administrators work with the Curse development and product teams on designing the software used by the forum, representing the needs of the Minecraft Forum community in these discussions.

## Forum Administrators

Forum Administrators are responsible for individual forum sections, they manage and support the section moderators, make decisions about section structure and serve as the Site Administrators point of contact. Forum Administrators work together with the Site Administrators to manage appeals and member support.

## Moderators

Moderators contribute towards ensuring that their assigned section(s) are clean and well organised by removing rule violating posts, organising threads into the correct sections and helping members understand and follow the forum rules with warnings.
Moderators are encouraged to use their experience and expertise in their areas of interest to work with the Forum and Site Administrators to identify ways the forum can be improved.


# Account Management

## Password Security

Password security is very important, even more so when your password protects an account that has elevated access. Minecraft Forum staff have access to a wide variety of tools and private information on the forum and therefore need to take password security seriously, please read [Password Do's and Don'ts](http://krebsonsecurity.com/password-dos-and-donts/) before choosing your Minecraft Forum password.

## 2 Factor Authentication

The Minecraft Forum Control Panel is protected by [2 Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication), staff must verify their identity using their mobile phone when logging into the Control Panel from a new IP Address. A mobile phone number can be set via [My Account](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account) from a whitelisted IP. Staff members without access to a mobile phone for 2 Factor Authentication should speak to a site administrator about alternatives.

## Account Compromises

Staff members should always err on the side of caution and inform administrators of any concerns they have about their account security, this includes Minecraft Forum accounts, Email accounts and Trello accounts. Administrators must be informed immediately when there has been a compromise so that the Minecraft Forum account access can be locked down.

# Moderation Tools

## Account Preferences

Moderators have access to additional options, these options are managed via [My Account > Preferences](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/preferences).
    
* Show Deleted Content 
* Show Content Marked as Spam
* Show Hellban Content
* Show Censored Content

These options should always be enabled because effective moderation depends on having all relevant information, which can often be within hidden posts.

## Reports

Members report items (such as posts, members, comments, servers) by selecting from a list of pre-defined reasons and providing any relevant information in the report description. Each pre-defined reason has a description to explain to the member when that report reason is appropriate to use.

### "Delete ALL posts"

When you see a report asking for you to delete all their posts, you can decline the report. Then, you can Private Message them and let them know that they need to [submit a ticket](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support). 

### Statuses

Reports enter the system with the **new** status and from there moderators change the status as the report is acted on.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **New** | Nobody has acted on this report yet |
| **Under Review** | A moderator is currently working on this report |
| **Escalated** | A specific staff member is responsible for this report |
| **Resolved** | The issue has been investigated and resolved |
| **Declined** | The reported issue was not valid |

### Escalating a Report

Some reports require input from or action by a specific member of staff, however the report system does not have native support for assigning reports. To work around this issue we use Trello and the Escalated report status. A card should be created and assigned to the staff member on the [Forum Moderation Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/VP7ordvf/forum-moderation) with a link to the report attached, then the report should be marked as Escalated with a comment linking to the Trello card.

## Status Notes

Status notes are used to communicate information about a thread to visitors or staff. A public status note is visible to everyone who visits the thread, a private status note is only visible to staff members. A status note can be added using the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu or using the Reason option when deleting an item.

## Moving Threads

Click <kbd>Move Thread</kbd> from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu in the thread, then select the destination forum from the list. If you wish to leave a Redirect Notice in the section where the thread is currently located select "Leave a redirect notice on the original forum" and enter the duration the Redirect Notice should remain for. Moderators decide on the duration using the following guidelines:

* If a thread has no replies do not use a redirect notice.
* If a thread is under 2 hours old a 2 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.
* If a thread has over 20 replies (2+ pages) a 12 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.
* If a thread is very active (5+ pages) a 24 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.

Redirect notices should be used when it's likely that people will visit the section expecting to find the thread, and if a thread is very popular it is quite likely this will happen.

## Locking Threads

Locking a thread prevents other members from posting in it. To lock a thread, click on <kbd>Lock thread</kbd> from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu in the thread. After a thread has been locked a comment should be made explaining why it has been locked, unless the original poster has asked for the thread to be locked.

## Deleting Content

The <kbd>Delete</kbd> option hides content from public view and collapses the content for staff members. To delete content use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> option in the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu, optionally leaving a Reason.

## Post History 

To view the history of a post, including all changes made by the author and moderators, click on <kbd>Post History</kbd> in the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu. From the drop down menu of revisions you can preview by selecting a revision, and Rollback to a revision if neccessary. 

## Spam

The forum's built-in spam filter can automatically marks posts as spam when they're created, and learns from posts that are marked as spam by staff members. For example, if a post containing "Football" is marked as spam, then the next time a post containing "Football" is posted, the filter is more likely to consider that post spam. Content must only be marked as spam when it is content that we want the filter to automatically identify as spam, for example posts advertising VIAGRAÂ®.

Spam is posts (or threads) generally created by new accounts that has been made for the sole purpose of advertising non-Minecraft content. To mark a thread as spam, from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu select <kbd>Mark as Spam</kbd> for Threads and <kbd>Spam</kbd> for posts. Do not mark posts such as "bump" or "lol" as spam, because the automatic spam filter learns from posts that have been marked as spam, and incorrectly marking posts may cause legitimate posts to be marked as spam. If you're not sure if something qualifies as spam please speak to an administrator.

# Forum Management With Trello

Trello is a task management application that we use to help with management of the forum: staff members can assign tasks to others and keep track of the tasks they're responsible for, with tasks organised across different boards for different sections of management.

Visit [trello.com/signup](https://trello.com/signup) to create an account, then add your Minecraft Forum username to your Bio via [Account Details](https://trello.com/my/account). After you've registered your Trello account your Forum Administrator will add you to the organisation. Trello is very straight forward and you should be able to get started right away, but if you'd like to learn more before diving in then there are many guides provided by Trello, covering everything from [getting started with Trello](https://trello.com/guide) to [becoming a Trello pro](http://help.trello.com/article/734-how-to-use-trello-like-a-pro). Experienced staff members are happy to answer any questions you have too.

Every staff member is encouraged to explore the various boards to learn about what is happening with the forum management and to find places to contribute, through sharing thoughts, opinions, ideas and working on tasks. Ask an administrator if you have any questions or are looking for places to contribute and they will point you in the right direction.

# Warnings

The warning system is an on the record way to communicate with members about the Minecraft Forum rules, each warning is an opportunity for a member to learn more about the forum rules, they are not a punishment. Staff members must treat each warning discussion as an opportunity to help the recipient better understand the rules, replying to questions or concerns raised by a member in response to a warning is just as important as issuing warnings. Staff members should escalate a Private Message conversation about a warning if they're unable to provide the information the member needs.

## Appeals  

Members can submit appeals if they feel that a warning has been issued incorrectly. You'll be able to see the user who submitted the appeal, the type of appeal (warning, ban, etc), the description for the appeal, and links to all the necessary information. You can view appeals in the [moderation control panel](http://www.minecraftforum.net/cp/appeals), however moderators are not permitted to participate in the appeal process unless asked by an administrator on an appeal by appeal basis.

## Bans

A ban is a restriction on a members account. These restrictions can affect posting, visiting and interacting with the forum. When you issue a formal warning to someone they receive warning points dependent on the Warning Definition. These points are then used to trigger automatic posting bans, and the length of a posting depends on the amount of points.

| Points | Posting Ban |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No ban |
| 2 | 3 Days |
| 3 | 5 Days |
| 4 | 7 Days |
| 5 | 14 Days | 
| 6+ | 30 Days |

## Member Administrative Reviews (MARs)

If a member repeatedly breaks the forum rules or behaves in a manner that raises concerns about their presence on the forum then a Member Administrative Review can be conducted. Any member of staff can create a Member Administrative Review on the Forum Moderation board following the guidelines outlined in the [Member Administrative Review](https://trello.com/c/4c3Dy6jJ/1867-member-administrative-review) card. 

There are no criteria for when a member should have an Member Administrative Review, it is up to each individual staff member to decide if they think one is neccessary. Usually when a member reaches 4 or more warnings in a short period of time a MAR will be created.

## Malicious Material

If you know something on the fourms is malicious, you need to issue the Malicious Material warning. From there, you need to remove the post(s)/thread(s) containing the malicious material. Then, you need to create a Member Administrative Review card explaining why you issued the warning, links to virus scans, the member, etc. We want to make sure that the member is properly banned and the material checked before we ban someone. 

To check if content is malicious you can:
1) Ask in staff-moderation for another moderator to help you. 
2) Use virustotal.com to scan the URL (If applicable)
3) Download the file and upload it to virustotal.com without opening it. 

If you don't know how to properly and efficiently test something for malware, ask! We work as a team and together, we can determine if something is malicious or not.

## Accidental Warnings

If you issue a warning by mistake, don't freak out, it's not the end of the world. What you want to do is immediately create a card on the Forum Moderation board under the To Do list. Then, since the member still received the pop up and the message, you'll need to let them know what happened.

## Alternate Account Policy

Recently, our alternate account policy has changed. Permanent bans are no longer issued issued to alternate accounts. Instead, you now issue the alternate account warning to all the accounts. The warnings need to have the appropriate comments so we can reference it in the future if we need to. The alternate accounts should have the main account in the comments and the alternate accounts should have the main account in the comments.

If a member is repeatedly using alternate accounts to violate rules, create a Member Administrative Review.

# Acount Security
Being a moderator gives you permissions above a normal member. Using those permissions requires great responsibility and account security is one of them. If someone gets access to your account, they can use those permissions. So, you need to make sure your password is secure:

* Never share your password with anyone (Even friends and family) - They can accidentally give your account out or even use your account
* Use a unique password for the Minecraft Forum - Your password needs to be unique! No one should be able to guess your password if they hack another platform and find your password.
* Use 2-Factor Authentification - Use it as often as you can. It's an additional security measure and if you're required to use it on the Minecraft Forum, why not use it on other services that offer it. 
* Do not use real information on security questions - This can be found on your social media accounts and can then be guessed
* Make sure you're logging into the correct website - Check the domain! Some websites copy others in an attempt to get your password for the right site. If you're logging into the Minecraft Forum, the domain should be https://www.minecraftforum.net you should see the green lock. 

## Password Management

Your password needs to be unique! Using the same password isn't a safe method. If you'd like, you can [generate a safe password here](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/). If you have a ton of accounts, you can even use a _Password Manager_. Password managers are databases that store your passwords. They can be local (Stored on your computer) or Cloud based (Stored on a database and can be accessed anywhere). A password manager is recommended. 

Whenever possible, you should try to protect your account with 2-Factor Authentification. In addition to having a secure password, you'll have a special code on your phone that you need to log in. 

## What do I do if my account was hacked?

You need to make sure you contact the administrators immediately! They'd be able to help you by removing your permissions and give you advice. From there, you should change your email, password, and make sure you have 2-factor authentification. If you don't have it enabled, enable it! It may seem pointless but it really does secure your account more than you think.
